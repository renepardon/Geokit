/**
 * A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.
 *
 * A simple Surface may consists of a single “patch” that is associated with one
 * “exterior boundary” and 0 or more “interior” boundaries. A single such
 * Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a
 * simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0.
 * If the patch is not vertical, the projection onto the same plane is an
 * isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation, i.e. an
 * affine.
 *
 * Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by “stitching” together such simple Surfaces
 * patches along their common boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a
 * 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the
 * orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment
 * (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is
 * co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.
 *
 * The boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to
 * its “exterior” and “interior” boundaries.
 *
 * The only instantiable subclasses of Surface defined in this standard are
 * Polygon and PolyhedralSurface. A Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar.
 * A PolyhedralSurface is a simple surface, consisting of some number of Polygon
 * patches or facets. If a PolyhedralSurface is closed, then it bounds a solid.
 * A MultiSurface containing a set of closed PolyhedralSurfaces can be used to
 * represent a Solid object with holes.
